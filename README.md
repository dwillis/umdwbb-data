# UMDWBB-DATA

This repository includes data from Maryland Women's Basketball games from the 2014-15 season through the 2019-20 season. The data comes from the official university site (see [an example game](https://umterps.com/sports/womens-basketball/stats/2019-20/iowa/boxscore/11719)) and is not changed. A Python scraper for the data is included.
